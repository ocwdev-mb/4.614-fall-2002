Concepts

Brought by the Prophet Muhammad (570-632) in Arabia, it soon spread all over the southern and eastern Mediterranean, Africa, and south, east, and central Asia. In Arabic, the word Islam literally means "to surrender, to submit (to the will of God)", which is the essence of the religion.

**Mecca:** The cult and trade center.
