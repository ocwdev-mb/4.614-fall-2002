Concepts
--------

**The Ayyubids:** A family of Kurdish amirs who ruled Syria and Egypt (1176-1250). Their founder was Salah al-Din (Saladin), the exemplary knight and hero of the Counter-Crusade.

**The Mamluks:** A curious phenomenon that is not encountered outside the Islamic world, Mamluks were imported slaves, mostly of Turkish or Caucasian stock, who were destined for a military career. The Mamluks ruled Egypt and Syria from 1250 to 1517.

**Waqf:** Endowment deed. In the medieval period, amirs and dignitaries endowed charitable structures both for pious and social reasons and as a means to preserve some of the wealth generated by their _iqta'_, or revenues form land holdings granted by the state only while they are actively in the service.

**Khanqah:** Institution for sufis which usually contains a mosque, quarters for a number of sufis, and a meeting hall where the _hudur_ is performed. Its introduction into the urban environmrnt in major cities marked the recognition of popular religious practices by both the ruling and the clerical classes.

**Hudur:** Sufi acts of devotion which took the form of dancing, singing, and whirling among other ways. Each Sufi order had its distinctive _hudur_.

**Madrasa of Sultan al-Salih Najm al-Din Ayyub**

(1243) First madrasa in Cairo to accommodate the four schools of law. Built in the heart of the Fatimid city, it was composed of two separate, self-contained courtyard units, parallel in plan, separated by a passage, and having each two large iwans. A mausoleum for the founder was added shortly after the completion of the complex by Shajar al-Durr, his wife.

**The Mosque of Sultan al-Zahir Baybars in Cairo**

(1267-9): First royal Mamluk mosque in Cairo. Hypostyle in plan, and fortress-like in elevation, the mosque with its three portals displays local and Seljuk influences. Its {{% resource_link 851489fb-7279-2905-c810-64a265ac9cc3 "minbar" "#minbar" %}} and {{% resource_link 851489fb-7279-2905-c810-64a265ac9cc3 "mihrab" "#mihrab" %}} are said to have been built with wood and marble taken from a Crusader's church in Jaffa.

**The Mosque of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in Cairo**

(1318 and 1335). This hypostyle structure is distinguished by the arrangement of alternate courses of red and black stone in its arches and niches, and by its two unusual {{% resource_link 851489fb-7279-2905-c810-64a265ac9cc3 "minarets" "#minaret" %}} which may have been a direct import from Ilkhanid Iran.

**The Khanqah of Sultan Baybars al-Jashankir**

(1307-10). A structure with a biaxial plan, this Khanqa had a mausoleum added on its {{% resource_link 851489fb-7279-2905-c810-64a265ac9cc3 "qibla" "#qibla" %}} side. It contained rooms for the sufis aligned on its two longitudinal sides.

**The Complex of Sultan Qalawun in Cairo**

(1284-85). Contains a bimaristan (hospital), a madrasa, and a mausoleum for the founder. The street fa√ßade is well articulated and shows the confluence of Syrian (Crusader and Islamic) arrangements. The {{% resource_link 851489fb-7279-2905-c810-64a265ac9cc3 "madrasa" "#madrasa" %}} is a four-iwan type with a basilical organization in the {{% resource_link 851489fb-7279-2905-c810-64a265ac9cc3 "qibla" "#qibla" %}} iwan. The Dome of the mausoleum echoes the octagonal plan of the Dome of the Rock.
