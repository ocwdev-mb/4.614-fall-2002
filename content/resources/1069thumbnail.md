description: 'The Great Mosque and Hospital of Divrik (Divrigi): Established by the
  wife of Ahmet Shah, the Mengujukid ruler of the city, in 1228-29, the mosque manifests
  the new development of hypostyle mosques in Anatolia (the reduction of the court),
  and the fusion of several traditions in the nascent architectural vocabulary. Very
  complex, and sometimes chaotic, themes and modes of stone carving appear in the
  portals. This makes the entire structure a curious museum of the various Anatolian
  decorative styles of the period.'
