The Complex of Sultan Qalawun in Cairo (1284-85): Contains a bimaristan (hospital), a madrasa, and a mausoleum for the founder. The street fa?ade is well articulated and shows the confluence of Syrian (Crusader and Islamic) arrangements. The madrasa is a four-iwan type with a basilical organization in the qiblai wan. The Dome of the mausoleum echoes the octagonal plan of the Dome of the Rock.
