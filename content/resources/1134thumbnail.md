description: Central Dome Mosques Based on Four Supports with Two or More Half-Domes
  (1550-57). The largest Ottoman half-domed mosque, it sits on the top of the sixth
  hill that dominates the city and cascades down in a pyramidical arrangement of its
  domes, half-domes, counterweights, and butresses. The mosque forms the center of
  a kulliye with a dar al-hadith, four madrasas, an imaret, a tabkhane, a mektab,
  a medical school (tibb medrese), bath, fountain, and the mausolea of the founder,
  his wife, and Sinan himself (in a corner).
