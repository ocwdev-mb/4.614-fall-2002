description: The Corniche Mosque, Jedda, Saudi Arabia (1986). One of a series of small
  mosques commissioned by the Saudi government and designed by the Egyptian architect
  Abd al-Wahid al-Wakil. He freely blends together forms, and even fragments of forms,
  to create plastic, sculpture-like structures. The results are always visually pleasing,
  but somewhat disturbing in their indifference toward the disparate, and sometimes
  clashing, traditions from which they were copied.
