description: 'The Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha, Cairo Citadel. Built between 1830
  and 1848, the mosque has a pure central-domed plan with two slender pencil minarets.
  Its surface articulation contrasts sharply in its eclecticism with its structural
  straightforwardness. The mosque is a rhetorical composition designed to emulate
  the early style of royal Ottoman mosques of Istanbul. The initial design of the
  mosque by the French architect Pascal Coste was to apply a neo-Mamluk style. Coste
  designed two mosques for Muhammad Ali: one in Alexandria and the Citadel mosque.
  Neither was ever built.'
