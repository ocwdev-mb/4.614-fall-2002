description: The Mausoleum of Sultan Olje?tu at Sultaniyya (1307-13). Intended as
  a major component of a larger complex, this octagonal structure with eight slender
  minarets and a huge, blue-glazed dome is not well understood. Olje?tu had the idea
  of transforming it into a mashhad for Ali and his son al-Husayn when he converted
  to Shiism but then changed his mind again and made it his own, and plastered the
  interior. The building shows the striving for verticality and the perfection of
  pre-existing traditions.
